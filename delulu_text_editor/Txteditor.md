This Project is based on the development and articles published by Paige Ruten for Build your own text editor

I tried to learn and implement the basics of C while creating a text editor with different kinds of extra functions
to be added accordingly.

"Try try with no cry": Moto of the project

Day#2 tried and implemented a simple reading the line and input parameter inside the code and then also created a copy of it as i like the concept and we may also write some terminal commands after the termination keyword just like here its "p"
The name of file is cmd_prp.c
Adios
